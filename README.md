# Retail SOP Performance Analysis

## 1. Project Background
This personal data project focuses on analyzing Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) adherence across 32 retail branches. By leveraging mystery shopper data, the project aims to identify overall SOP compliance, pinpoint top and bottom performing branches, and generate actionable insights and recommendations for improving operational efficiency and service quality.

## 2. Executive Summary
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of SOP adherence across 32 retail branches, utilizing data collected from mystery shopper surveys. The core objective was to assess overall compliance, identify high and low-performing branches, and derive practical insights to enhance operational standards. The analysis involved data cleaning and preparation in Excel, followed by visualization and performance analysis in Tableau. The findings offer a clear picture of current SOP implementation and highlight areas for improvement, emphasizing the blend of data analysis with human judgment for effective storytelling.

## 3. Insights

Based on the analysis of SOP adherence across retail branches, the following key insights were identified:

*   **Overall SOP Compliance:** The project provides a clear picture of the general level of SOP adherence across all 32 branches, indicating areas where compliance is strong and where it needs improvement.
*   **Top and Bottom Performing Branches:** Specific branches were identified as consistently excelling in SOP adherence, while others showed significant room for improvement. This allows for targeted interventions and best practice sharing.
*   **Actionable Insights & Recommendations:** The analysis led to concrete insights that can be translated into practical recommendations for branch managers and operational teams to enhance SOP compliance and overall performance.

## 4. Recommendations

Based on the insights derived from the SOP performance analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

*   **Implement Targeted Training:** For branches identified as low-performing, implement specific training programs focusing on the SOPs where adherence is weakest.
*   **Share Best Practices:** Analyze the methods and strategies employed by top-performing branches and disseminate these best practices across the entire network.
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Establish a system for continuous monitoring of SOP adherence, possibly through more frequent mystery shopper visits or internal audits, to track progress and ensure sustained improvement.
*   **Leverage Technology:** Utilize tools like Tableau for ongoing visualization and performance tracking, making it easier to identify trends and address issues proactively.

## Tools Used

*   **Excel:** For initial data cleaning and preparation, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.
*   **Tableau:** For data visualization and performance analysis, creating interactive dashboards to present findings.
*   **Manus AI:** Utilized for AI-powered slide creation, demonstrating how AI can speed up workflows and improve storytelling.

## What I Learned

This project reinforced a crucial understanding: while AI is a great assistant to speed up workflows and improve storytelling, human thinking, analysis, and judgment remain at the core of effective data analysis and problem-solving. The ability to ask the right business questions, interpret complex patterns, and translate them into actionable strategies is uniquely human.
